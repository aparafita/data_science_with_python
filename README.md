# data_science_with_python
Repository for Notebooks that explain Data Science with Python.

Overview of many of the steps needed to do a Data Science project in Python.

Most notebooks depend on domino.utils.jupyter.notebook_init, 
so it is recommended to install domino (from aparafita/domino) in order to run them as-is.

Note: Python3 only.
